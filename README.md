If you accidentally ran this on Linux, while your favorite music streaming app was playing, it might take control of your player and record its output, song-by-song, skipping songs that already exist, and embedding ID3 metadata. That would be really bad. Strongly discouraged.

Why would anyone want to do such a terrible thing? Well, some people like listening to music when they drive, and their car has a USB port and hands-free interface dedicated to playing MP3s off a flash drive, and they prefer to leave their phone in their pocket.

### Requirements

Ubuntu packages:

```
sudo apt install \
  build-essential \
  python3 \
  python3-dev \
  python3-venv \
  portaudio19-dev \
  ffmpeg \
  libavcodec-extra
```

From your favorite music streaming service:

- A developer account and application. The application will have a client ID and secret.
- A refresh token. [Hereâ€™s an example for generating one](https://github.com/danrashid/brownies/tree/master/docs).

### Recommendations

- pavucontrol (Ubuntu package) for selecting your monitor channel for input. Or you can [try to do it manually](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples#ALSA_monitor_source). While `main.py` is running, successful capturing looks like this in pavucontrol:

### One-time setup

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy `template.env` to `.env` and adjust its values.

### Usage example

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ REFRESH='<Insert refresh token here>'
$ ./main.py $REFRESH ~/Music/
```

### Help

```
$ ./main.py --help
```
